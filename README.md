# My-web_development-journey-
Hi there! 🚀 I started learning about websites from scratch and here's my story:

# HTML:
I began with HTML, the basic language for making websites.
# CSS:
Then came CSS, which makes websites look cool and stylish.
# JavaScript:
I learned JavaScript to add fun and interactive things to websites.
# Bootstrap:
Used Bootstrap to make designing websites easier and more organized.
# Projects:
I did projects to practice what I learned and get better at building things.
# Node.js:
I moved on to Node.js, a tool to make the backend (the behind-the-scenes stuff) of websites.
# Express:
Now, I'm learning Express to make the backend even more powerful and flexible.
# Handlebars (hbs) in Node.js:
Also, I'm using Handlebars with Node.js to make things like showing dynamic content on websites easier.
This readme is like a little diary of my journey. Feel free to check out the projects, let me know what you think, and join me on this adventure of learning cool web stuff. There's more to come! 🌐✨
